## AI Prompts for Customization

### Step 1: Rename App

Ask your AI agent:
```
@flutter-developer Please rename this Flutter app:
- Current name: "min_flutter_template"
- New name: "my_awesome_app"
- Current package: "com.cmwen.min_flutter_template"
- New package: "com.mycompany.my_awesome_app"

Update all necessary files including:
- pubspec.yaml
- lib/main.dart (imports and title)
- test/widget_test.dart (imports)
- android/app/build.gradle.kts (namespace and applicationId)
- android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml (label)

After updating, run flutter pub get and verify everything compiles.
```

### Step 2: Generate App Icon

```
@icon-generation.prompt.md

Create an app launcher icon for my [TYPE OF APP] app.

Requirements:
- App concept: [DESCRIBE YOUR APP]
- Style: [flat/gradient/minimal/modern]
- Primary color: #[HEX CODE]
- Secondary color: #[HEX CODE]
- Symbol/concept: [DESCRIBE ICON CONCEPT]
- Background: [transparent/solid color]

Please provide:
1. A 1024x1024 PNG master icon
2. Instructions for using flutter_launcher_icons package
3. Alt text for accessibility

Save the master icon to assets/icon/app_icon.png and help me set up 
flutter_launcher_icons in pubspec.yaml.
```

### Step 3: Customize Theme

```
@flutter-developer Please customize the app theme in lib/main.dart:

Brand colors:
- Primary: #[HEX] ([COLOR NAME])
- Secondary: #[HEX] ([COLOR NAME])
- Background: #[HEX]
- Surface: #[HEX]
- Error: #[HEX]

Requirements:
- Use Material Design 3
- Support dark mode
- Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios
- Use ColorScheme.fromSeed for consistency
```

### Step 4: Define Product Requirements

```
@product-owner I want to build a [TYPE OF APP] with the following capabilities:

Core features:
1. [FEATURE 1]
2. [FEATURE 2]
3. [FEATURE 3]

Target users:
- [USER PERSONA 1]
- [USER PERSONA 2]

Please create:
1. Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
2. Feature prioritization (MVP vs future)
3. Non-functional requirements
4. Success metrics and KPIs

Save requirements to docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
```

### Step 5: Design User Experience

```
@experience-designer Based on the product requirements in docs/REQUIREMENTS.md, 
please design:

1. Information architecture (screen hierarchy)
2. Navigation structure (tab bar, drawer, or stack-based)
3. User flows for key features
4. Wireframes for main screens
5. Accessibility considerations

Constraints:
- Platform: Android
- Target devices: Mobile phones and tablets
- Material Design 3 components

Save design to docs/UX_DESIGN.md
```

### Step 6: Research Dependencies

```
@researcher I need to find the best Flutter packages for:

1. State Management - [brief description of needs]
2. Local Database - [data structure and requirements]
3. HTTP Client - [API integration needs]

For each category, please:
- Recommend top 3 packages with pros/cons
- Check latest version and maintenance status
- Verify compatibility with Flutter 3.10+
- Consider package size and performance
- Check license compatibility

Save findings to docs/DEPENDENCIES_RESEARCH.md
```

### Step 7: Plan Architecture

```
@architect Based on the requirements and dependencies research, please design:

Project structure:
- Folder organization (screens, widgets, models, services, providers)
- State management pattern
- Data layer architecture
- API integration approach
- Navigation structure

Provide:
1. Directory structure with purpose of each folder
2. Data flow diagram
3. Key architectural patterns to follow
4. Code organization guidelines

Save to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
```

### Step 8: Implement First Feature

```
@flutter-developer Implement [FEATURE NAME] feature:

Requirements:
- [REQUIREMENT 1]
- [REQUIREMENT 2]
- [REQUIREMENT 3]

Technical approach:
- Follow architecture in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Create necessary models in lib/models/
- Implement UI in lib/screens/[feature_name]/
- Use widgets from lib/widgets/ for reusable components
- Implement business logic in lib/services/
- Add state management with [chosen solution]

After implementation:
1. Write unit tests for business logic
2. Write widget tests for UI components
3. Run flutter analyze
4. Run flutter test
5. Document any public APIs
6. Code formatting is handled automatically by CI
```

### Step 9: Create Release Build

```
@flutter-developer Please help me create the first release build:

1. Verify all customizations are complete
2. Update version in pubspec.yaml to 1.0.0+1
3. Build release artifacts:
   - Android: APK and AAB
4. Test release build on device
5. Create git tag v1.0.0
6. Push tag to trigger release workflow

Provide step-by-step commands.
```
