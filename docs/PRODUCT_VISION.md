---
**Created**: December 6, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Initial Draft  
**Stakeholders**: Product, Development, Design  
---

## Executive Summary

**ReadForge** is a local-first AI-powered book library application that enables users to create, manage, and read LLM-generated books. Unlike traditional e-readers, ReadForge serves as both a content management system for AI-generated literature and a full-featured reading experience.

## Vision Statement

> *Empower readers to become authors of their own literary experiences, using AI as a creative partner while maintaining complete ownership and control of their content.*

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

1. **Fragmented AI Content Creation**: Users generate content with LLMs but lack a dedicated system to organize, manage, and iterate on long-form content like books
2. **Context Loss**: When working with LLMs on book-length content, maintaining consistency across chapters is challenging
3. **Data Ownership**: Most AI content tools are cloud-based, leaving users without true ownership of their creations
4. **Reading Experience Gap**: AI-generated content often ends up in plain text files or documents, lacking a proper reading experience

### Target Users

1. **Creative Readers**: People who want personalized stories, educational content, or reference materials
2. **Language Learners**: Users generating content in their target language with controlled vocabulary
3. **Educators**: Teachers creating customized educational materials
4. **Hobbyist Writers**: Writers using AI as a brainstorming and drafting partner
5. **Privacy-Conscious Users**: Those who want full control over their data and AI interactions

## Core Value Propositions

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Local-First** | All data stored on device, user owns everything |
| **Context-Aware Generation** | Smart prompt generation that maintains book integrity |
| **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** | Use any LLM provider with your own API keys |
| **Full Reading Experience** | Not just a generator, but a complete e-reader |
| **Derivative Works** | Fork books to create variations and adaptations |
| **Data Portability** | Easy export in standard formats |

## Product Principles

1. **User Ownership First**: The user's data is theirs—always exportable, never locked in
2. **Offline Capable**: Core functionality works without internet
3. **LLM Agnostic**: Works with any LLM via intent sharing or API
4. **Reading-Centric**: Generation is a means to an end—the reading experience matters most
5. **Progressive Complexity**: Simple to start, powerful for advanced users
6. **Respect Creativity**: Encourage original works over copying existing authors

## Success Metrics

### North Star Metric
**Monthly Active Reading Hours** - Time users spend reading their generated content

### Supporting Metrics
- Books created and completed
- Chapters generated per book
- Export rate (indicates users value their content)
- Return reading sessions (indicates engaging content)
- Derivative books created (indicates value of forking feature)

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Differentiation |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| KOReader | Excellent reading UX, open source | No content generation | Generation + Reading combined |
| ChatGPT | Powerful generation | No organization, context loss | Structured book management |
| NovelAI | Good for fiction | Cloud-dependent, subscription | Local-first, BYOK |
| Calibre | Great library management | No generation, desktop-only | Mobile + AI integration |

## Future Vision (12-month outlook)

1. **P2P Sync**: Decentralized sync between user's devices
2. **Community Sharing**: Optional sharing of book templates/structures (not content)
3. **Voice Integration**: Text-to-speech for generated content
4. **Multi-platform**: Expand to iOS and desktop
5. **Plugin System**: Extensible for advanced users
